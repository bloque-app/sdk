# Introduction

Welcome to the Bloque SDK documentation. Bloque provides a comprehensive financial infrastructure platform that enables developers to create organizations, verify user identities, and issue virtual cards programmatically.

## What is Bloque SDK?

The Bloque SDK is a TypeScript-first library that simplifies integration with Bloque's financial services platform. It provides a unified interface for:

- **Organization Management**: Create and manage business and individual organizations
- **KYC Verification**: Implement Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance workflows
- **Virtual Cards**: Issue virtual cards instantly for your users
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements with built-in compliance tools

## Key Features

### 🏢 Organization Management

Create and manage organizations with complete profile information, supporting both businesses and individuals.

```typescript
const organization = await bloque.orgs.create({
  org_type: 'business',
  profile: {
    legal_name: 'Acme Corporation',
    tax_id: '123456789',
    // ... more fields
  },
});
```

### ✅ KYC Verification

Verify user identities with a simple API and receive real-time updates via webhooks.

```typescript
const verification = await bloque.compliance.kyc.startVerification({
  urn: 'did:bloque:user:123',
  webhookUrl: 'https://api.example.com/webhooks/kyc',
});
```

### 💳 Virtual Cards

Issue virtual cards instantly with PCI-compliant card detail management.

```typescript
const card = await bloque.accounts.card.create({
  urn: 'did:bloque:user:123',
  name: 'My Business Card',
});
```

## Architecture

The Bloque SDK is organized into three main modules:

```
@bloque/sdk
├── orgs        # Organization management
├── compliance  # KYC and compliance
└── accounts    # Virtual cards and accounts
```

Each module is independently accessible but works seamlessly together to provide a complete financial infrastructure solution.
